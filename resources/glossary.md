# Glossary

### accent

One of three types of symbol [elements](glossary.md#element), along with [shafts](glossary.md#shaft) and [flags](glossary.md#flag).

The [core](glossary.md#core) of a Sagittal symbol, or [sagittal](glossary.md#sagittal), consists of the shafts and usually at least one flag. Everything besides the core is an accent.

Elements are always sorted from right to left away from the note in order of decreasing size of the pitch alteration they represent. Accents always represent smaller pitch alterations than shafts and flags. Therefore, accents are always found to the left of a core. 

The graphical size of elements generally corresponds to the size of the pitch alteration they represent. Therefore, relatedly, accents are also graphically smaller than core elements. 

Unlike flags, which always point in the same direction, accents are allowed to point in different directions from the flags. When there is more than one accent, they are even allowed to point in different directions from each other.

The first [symbol set](glossary.md#symbol-set) which introduces accents is [Herculean](glossary.md#herculean), which introduces the acute and grave. The next symbol set, [Olympian](glossary.md#olympian), introduces the breve, inverted breve, double breve, and inverted double breve.

In linguistics, an accent is a type of mark which adjusts the pitch of spoken language. Its etymology includes "song added to speech". In this sense, "accent" is a great word for the tiny adjustments of pitch in Sagittal.

### apotome

### apotome complement

### apotome slope

### arc

A type of [flag](glossary.md#arc), and thus a symbol [element](glossary.md#element).

### Athenian

The name of the second [symbol set](glossary.md#symbol-set), and thus the first [extension](glossary.md#extension).

### barb

A type of [flag](glossary.md#arc), and thus a symbol [element](glossary.md#element).

### capture zone

### chromatic semitone

### comma

The word comma has two meanings in Sagittal:

1. It is the general term for any of the small pitch intervals which Sagittal symbols represent.
2. It is also the specific term for one of the seven size categories of these pitch intervals \(the one exactly in the middle, with three on either side\).

The seven size categories of commas represented by Sagittal symbols are, in order from smallest to largest: schismina, schisma, kleisma, comma, small diesis, medium diesis, and large diesis. Size is the only criterion for these categories. Each boundary between categories is defined by the square root of a meaningful 3-limit comma.

The specific category that is called comma has a lower boundary of 11.730¢ and an upper boundary of 33.382¢.

### core

The part of a Sagittal symbol, or [sagittal](glossary.md#sagittal), consisting of just the [shaft](glossary.md#shaft) and [flags](glossary.md#flag), if any \(excluding any [accents](glossary.md#accent)\).

### diesis

### element

Short for symbol element.

Each Sagittal symbol, or [sagittal](glossary.md#sagittal), is built out of at least two elements. Three types of symbol elements exist: [shafts](glossary.md#shaft), [flags](glossary.md#flag), and [accents](glossary.md#accent).

Every sagittal has at least one shaft, and at least one flag or diacritic. No sagittal has more than four shafts, three flags, or three diacritics.

Shafts and flags together comprise the [core](glossary.md#core) of a sagittal. 

### element arithmetic

For every flag or accent, a sagittal exists which consists of a single shaft plus that flag or accent. Element arithmetic deals with the [primary comma](glossary.md#primary-comma)s from these sagittals. 

Every sagittal has a [sum-of-elements](glossary.md#sum-of-elements) value which is calculated using element arithmetic. The primary commas for each of its elements are combined \(in their tempered form, if relevant\).

### Evo

One of the two [flavors](glossary.md#flavor) of Sagittal. Evo is short for "evolutionary". 

### extension

### flag

One of three types of symbol [elements](glossary.md#element), along with [shafts](glossary.md#shaft) and [accents](glossary.md#accent).

### flavor

### Herculean

### Magrathean

### native-fifth notation

### nominal

### precision level

### primary comma

### prime count vector

Also known as a _harmonic space coordinate_, a prime interval vector expresses a rational number in a form which makes it immediately clear how many of each prime number it is composed of.

Each term of a prime interval vector corresponds to a different prime. Unless otherwise specified, the first term corresponds to the first prime, 2, the second term corresponds to the second prime, 3, and so on for the remaining terms: 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. 

The value of each term is the exponent to which you should raise that prime. The rational number is calculated, then, by taking each term of the vector, raising its corresponding prime to that power, and then multiplying all of these values together.

Let's look at an example. One syntonic comma up in ratio form looks like 81/80. In prime interval vector form, that same rational number looks like \| -4 4 -1 &gt;. This is because 2⁻⁴ × 3⁴ × 5⁻¹ = 81/80. 

Considering the numerator and denominator separately may be helpful. When the ratio is in reduced form, as 81/80 is, when you prime factorize both the numerator and the denominator, no prime found in one will also be found in the other. So you should always first get your ratio into reduced form. From there, you can simply take the counts of each prime in the numerator's factorization and make those into positive exponents, and conversely, take the counts of each prime in the denominator's factorization and make those negative. 81 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 3⁴, so that gives us the value of 4 for the term of 3. 80 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 = 2⁴ × 5¹, but for these powers we must make them negative so they will contribute to the denominator instead of the numerator.

A prime interval vector can leave off at any point, beyond which the remaining terms are implied to be 0 \(just as you might leave off the trailing zeros when representing 5/4 as a decimal 1.2; there is no need to write 1.20000000...\).

### sagittal

A lowercase _sagittal_ means a symbol in the uppercase _Sagittal_ notation system. A sagittal consists of a [core](glossary.md#core) \(one [shaft](glossary.md#shaft) and zero or more [flags](glossary.md#flag)\) plus zero or more [accents](glossary.md#accent). Shafts, flags, and accents are all types of symbol [elements](glossary.md#element).
